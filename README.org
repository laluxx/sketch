* Sketch

Sketch is a direct-to-screen drawing tool for X11 environments. Here's what it offers:

** Overlay Mode
   Your entire screen becomes a canvas, allowing you to draw without being restricted by window boundaries.

** Instant Access
   The Ctrl + Space keybind activates and deactivates Sketch globally. No need to switch applications or disrupt your workflow.

** Transparent Integration
   Sketch is there when you need it and invisible when you don't. It fits seamlessly into your desktop experience.
